# hydrationApp

## What
HydroApp is a console app that allows the user to keep track of their liquid ingestion per date and time.

##  why
It is important to keep hydrated and drink about 8 glasses of water per day. Even if you struggle drinking water it's better than nothing to drink anything else than not drink at all. This app has for purposes to hold yourself accountable to maintain your body functional.

##  how 
Press 1 to add your first glass of water, you will be asked how much you just drank, what you drank and what time it is on what day.
If you want to see your past entries press 2, and if you want to see them per liquid type or day you can press 3.
I reccommend you save your entries every time and load them every time, which you can do by pressing 10 and 11 respectively.

##  help
### How do I know how much I've just drank ?
It is very helpful to have one glass or bottle that you've measured the content of, that way you don't have to keep weighing your glass everytime.
For example measuring a soda glass it at its visible line and filling your glass at this level everytime is a good and easy way to be consistent, no problem if its not precise to its microliter.
You could also use a measuring jug as carafe and calculate the amount drunk if that's your thing.
